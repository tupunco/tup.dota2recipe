{"bio":"Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.","bio_l":"普利斯特·雷霆之怒是一名见多识广、勇于拼搏、无比虔诚的骑士，他被声望极高的骑士团长老抚养长大，作为他们的贴身侍卫，立誓遵守他们的命令。他将一生都献给了全知全能的神。骑士团毕生都在进行艰苦的圣战，而普利斯特也至死不渝的履行着他的职责，奉献他的力量以及那年轻人特有的热忱，从未有过怀疑。然而，多年的远征让他的长辈和上级都已经归于尘土，带着悔恨和愧疚，被埋葬在远征路上的墓穴里，他亲如兄弟的战友，在同那些拒绝臣服于全能之神的野蛮人的战斗中陨落，而他自己的亲卫，也被伏击、瘟疫吞噬，于是他开始质疑自己誓言的意义——远征的意义。经过了深刻的冥想，他离开了他的军队，长途跋涉回到了晴雪城——传说中的圣城，在那里，他对全能之神的祭司们发出了质问。从来没有哪个骑士胆敢如此，祭司们试图将他投入献祭之渊，然而普利斯特却如山一般无法撼动。因为当他俯视着祭司时，全身闪耀着圣洁之光，祭司们看到全能之神选择了他作为其显圣之身。年长的大祭司见状，便亲自花费了数周的时间，指引他前往圣城深处的密室，世间最为圣洁之地，在那里等着他的，并不是一些充满智慧的晦涩抽象的书籍，也不是什么供人信奉的洞窟遗迹，而是全能之神本尊。神在这个密室里已经居住了千万年，并且创造了世间万物，在星球周围创造了巨大的保护外壳，抵御来自其他世界的邪恶。全能之神告诉普利斯特，他创造了世界，并且给予了教徒世间的真理。骑士没有办法驳斥这个故事。也许全能之神只是一个被关在石牢里面的骗子，根本不是什么创世者，但是全能骑士也不再质疑他的信仰。他的战斗终于有了意义，毫无疑问，他身体里面涌动着神圣的光明之力，而他在战斗中带给战友的力量，更是不容置疑。","stats":"<img
